This check will make sure the schedule is running. If the check detects that the schedule is not run every minute, it will fail.

This check relies on cache.

## Usage

First, you must register the `ScheduleCheck`

```php
use Spatie\Health\Facades\Health;
use Spatie\Health\Checks\Checks\ScheduleCheck;

Health::checks([
    ScheduleCheck::new(),
]);
```

Next, you must schedule the `Spatie\Health\Commands\ScheduleCheckHeartbeatCommand` to run every minute. We recommend to put this command as the very last command in your schedule.

```php
// in app/Console/Kernel.php
use \Spatie\Health\Commands\ScheduleCheckHeartbeatCommand;

public function schedule(Schedule $schedule) {
    // your other commands

    $schedule->command(ScheduleCheckHeartbeatCommand::class)->everyMinute();
}
```

### Customize the cache store

This check relies on cache to work. We highly recommend creating a [new cache store](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/cache#configuration) and pass its name to `useCacheStore`

```php
use Spatie\Health\Facades\Health;
use Spatie\Health\Checks\Checks\ScheduleCheck;

Health::checks([
    ScheduleCheck::new()->useCacheStore('your-custom-store-name'),
]);
```

### Customizing the maximum heart beat age

The `ScheduleCheckHeartbeatCommand` will write the current timestamp into the cache. The `ScheduleCheck` will verify that that timestamp is not over a minute.

Should you get too many false positives, you can change the max age of the timestamp by calling `heartbeatMaxAgeInMinutes`.

```php
ScheduleCheck::new()->heartbeatMaxAgeInMinutes(2),
```
